# Library-free CNN implementation in C++ with forward/backward propagation and CPU parallelism..
Qinwu Xu (Jan 2023) https://github.com/qinwuxutexas/cnn_forward_backward_cplus

Notes:
the major contribution of this prototype covers the following:
  a) it derives the full procedure of CNN framework for classification problems and object detection, including the additonal feed forward layers: flatten-> fully-connected layers -> classification -> object location detection; 
  b) it was written in C++ with parallism options for CPUs. The  architecture is designed as object oriented with three classes and one main function: 
     (1) class: math operation; 
     (2) class: forward computation;
     (3) Class: backward computation;
     (4) main: read data in, train the model, and inference results.
